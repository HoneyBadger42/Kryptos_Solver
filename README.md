# Kryptos_Solver
-----------------
 
This repository is made to solve the Kryptos' 4th part.

My solving methods can be found in my source files' headers.
(My source files can be found in the directory `REFLECTION/ALGO/`)



The directories Part1, 2 and 3 contain:
- a ciphered text (enigma.txt)
- its solution (solution.txt)
- a script (Solve) to decipher enigma, using my algorithms, written in C



The Part4 contains:
- the ciphered text (enigma.txt)
- a script (getClues), to show all what I know about this text



In the `REFLECTION/` dir, you can find:
- strange facts I found, they might be clues...
- my algorithms (in 3 source files, written in C) in the `ALGO` dir
- the original Kryptos text (global_view)
- an english, and a multilingual dictionary (they are huge)
- interesting web links (`web_links/` dir)

Have fun,
feel free to help !

LET'S SOLVE IT !!
